12. Display the contents of the file friends in uppercase letters: cat friends.txt | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'

13. Store the contents of your home directory in a file called dir: ls ~ > dir

14. From the above file dir, display the file permissions and the name of the file only: cat dir | ls-l, ls -l | awk '{print $1,$9}' 

15. From the same dir file, store only the file names in a file called files: cat dir | ls-l, ls -l | awk '{print $9}' > files

16. From the same dir file, store only the permissions of files in a file called perms: cat dir | ls-l, ls -l | awk '{print $1}' > perms

17. From the same dir file, store only the file sizes in a file called sizes: cat dir | ls -l, ls -l | awk '{print $5}' > sizes

18. Display the file names, sizes and permissions from your directory in that order: ls -l | awk '{print $9,$5,$1}'

19. Display the number of users working on the system: who | wc -l

20. Find out the smallest file in your directory: ls -l | sort -k 5 -n | head -n 1

21. Display the total number of lines present in the file friends: wc -l friends.txt

22. Create the following fixed record format files (with “|” delimiter between fields) with the structure given below, and populate them with relevant data use these files to solve following questions. Find the record lengths of each file: wc -l emplist, wc -l deptlist, wc -l desiglist

25. Extract Emp.id, dept, dob and salary. (Use field specifications). Save output as cfile2: awk '{print $1,$4,$5,$6}' emplist > cfile2

26. Sort the emplist file in reverse order of Emp Names: sort -k2,2r emplist

27. Sort the emplist file on the salary field, and store the result in file srtf: sort -t'|' -k6,6n emplist > srtf

28. Sort the emplist file on designation followed by name: sort -t'|' -k3,3 -k2,2 emplist
