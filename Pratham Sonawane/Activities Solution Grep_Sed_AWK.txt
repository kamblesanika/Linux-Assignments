Pattern Matching using egrep
----------------------------
Create a file student.dat with following data

name surname marks grade
rameshchandra mane 79 A+
suresh bahrti 88 A++
rajat bhosle 25 C
suraj pancholi 65 A
manoj sharma 55 B
rahul varma 87 A++
manoj pandey 56 B
suraj rajguru 45 B

1. Display all names starting with s : egrep -i "^s" student.dat
2. Display whose name ending with e or i : egrep 'e$|i$' student.dat
3. Display who got 65 marks : egrep '\b65\b' student.dat
4. Display data of records whose surname is Sharma is varma : egrep 'sharma|varma' student.dat
5. Display who got grade A only : egrep ' A$' student.dat
6. Display whose 3rd charcter of name is r : egrep '^..r' student.dat
7. Display whose second character is a or r or t : egrep '^.[art]' student.dat
8. Display names whose length is exactly 5 character :egrep '^..... ' student.dat
9. Display names whose length is more than 6 character : egrep '^.{7,} ' student.dat
10. Display name whose marks are ending with 6 : egrep '\b6$' student.dat
11. Display grade with A+ only : egrep '\bA\+\b' student.dat

Noninteractive Editing using sed
---------------------------------

1. Copy the file  /etc/syslog.conf to the current directory as syslog.conf. Insert blank line after every line in the file syslog.conf. : 
cp /etc/syslog.conf ./syslog.cong
sed G syslog.conf
2. Remove the blank lines from the file syslog.conf : sed '/^$/d' syslog.conf
3. Print the first 3 lines of the file syslog.conf : sed -n '1,3p' syslog.conf
4. Print lines from 3rd to 5th from the file /etc/syslog.conf : sed -n '3,5p' /etc/syslog.conf
5. Insert some spaces in the beginning(leading spaces) & end of each line(trailing spaces) manually using vi editor
6. Through sed command remove the leading spaces & trailing spaces in the above file : 
7. Substitute kern with kernel in the file syslog.conf & then substitute back to kern.: sed -i 's/kern/kernel/g' syslog.conf
   sed -i 's/kernel/kern/g' syslog.conf

8. Search for the lines containing the word kern & write those lines into a file kern.conf : grep 'kern' syslog.conf > kern.conf
9. Print all the lines of the file syslog.conf except the 3rd line.: sed '3d' syslog.conf
10. Delete each line that contains the pattern kern : sed '/kern/d' syslog.conf > syslog.conf

Create a file “Employee.dat” with text as follows

James 76382 ECAP Chennai
John 34228 GRIT Hyderabad
Peter 22321 GE Bangalore
Albert 32342 GRIT Pune
Mathew 23222 ECAP Mumbai
Richard 23232 ACS Pune

1. Write a sed command to print only the lines starting at line 2 and ending with the letters “Pune” : sed -n '2,/Pune/p' Employee.dat
2. Write a sed command that will display the top 5 lines from the file : sed -n '1,5p' Employee.dat
3. Write a sed command that will substitute the word “Chennai” for "Pune" used in all instance of the word : sed 's/Chennai/Pune/g' Employee.dat
4. Write a sed command that will replace occurrence of the character e with the string UNIX in all lines. (Use –e option): sed 's/e/UNIX/g' Employee.dat
5. Write a sed command to delete blank lines : sed '/^$/d' Employee.dat
6. Write a sed command to delete lines from 3 to 5 : sed '3,5d' Employee.dat
7. Create a new file “ECAP.dat which has only the lines that contain the word
“ECAP” from Employee.dat : grep 'ECAP' Employee.dat > ECAP.dat



Report Generation using awk
---------------------------

1. Consider the results are stored in following format:

EmpID Name Subject Marks(/50)
E001 Nilesh Unix 30
E002 Nilesh DSA 20
Like these you have 10 records ( 5 of DSA and 5 of Unix)
Calculate the avg score secured in Unix and DSA and the first 2 topers in Unix and DSA each.

2. Write a script to get the report of the users logged on to the System in
the following formats. (Records should be sorted on logging time.)
Header must include company name and Date
Records in the format
Username Logged-in-time Terminal
Tailor should include total number of the users logged in.

3. Consider a text file containing the records (colon separated fields) in the format:
EmpName:EmpId:Subject:ObtMarks:TotMarks:Result
Write a script to get the result of “UNIX” Subject in the format (Considering the data file has TotMarks=50 for UNIX)

EmpName:ObtMark:MarksOutof35
The header of the report must contain total marks and the tailor must
specify the percentage result for that subject.
Also generate another summary result containing total number of
participants appeared, total number of participants passed, and Name of
the participants ranked Ist IInd, IIIrd with their total score.

4. Consider the Arizona roaster as an input data file for this exercise. Using
any combination of the text-processing utilities listed below, write a oneline shell command that performs each of the following tasks
(a) reports the number of players on the roster
(b) displays the roster in order by jersey number
(c) displays the roster in alphabetical order by surname
(d) displays the heaviest five players
(e) displays all players who attended Wisconsin

The Roaster is given below:-
JersyNo|Name,surname |linebackers|Weight | Date | Experience| Country
20 | Anderson, Damien |RB 5'10" | 212 | 07/17/1979 | 3 |Northwestern

35 | Carter,Dyshod |DB5'10" |197 | 06/18/1978 |2 | Kansas State
52 | Fisher,Levar |OLB6'01" |235 | 07/02/1979 |3| NorthCarolina
11 | Fitzgerald,Larry |WR6'04" |229| 08/31/1983 |10 |Pittsburgh
63 |Garcia,Frank |G6'02" | 302| 01/28/1972|10|Washington
64 |Grace,Steven |C6'03" |295| 02/13/1979 | 3|Arizona
84 |Hamilton,Lawrence |WR6'03" |205 |08/31/1980 |2|StephenF.Austin

5. Create an awk program which will displays the total number of users in the system.
6. Create an awk program which counts and at the end displays the following data: 
	No. of Bash Shell users:
	No. of Bourne Shell Users:
7. Create an awk program which displays only user name and the corresponding user id as in the following Report Format :
	User Name	User ID
	root		0
	daemon		1
	---------------------
	Total Number of users :
8. Create an awk program which prints the alternate lines like 2nd , 4th , 6th etc... from the file /etc/group.
9. Create an awk program which will display the file name and the size of the files in the current directory where the file size is more than 100 bytes
10. Using awk, print the user id, login shell & home directory of the user root.
11. Using awk print the user id, name & login shell of the system users [ System users are those whose uid is less than 500 ]
12. Using awk print the file name, owner and size of all the files in the /etc directory
